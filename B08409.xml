            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a Perſon of Quality, written by <hi>Mr. Edward Bagſhaw.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Believe you will be much ſurprized, when you underſtand that I write this, juſt as I am going to <hi>London,</hi> in obedience to a Warrant wherewith I was ſerved laſt Saturday. And, that I may not qualifie, but heighten your wonder, I purpoſe to give you a brief Account of my Life and Studies, wherewith I think I ſhall not only ſatisfie you, but likewiſe the World (if you think fit to communicate this Paper to them) that my carriage hath been ſuch as did not deſerve this rigor, to make it publickly taken notice of.</p>
            <p>When I came, or rather when I was driven out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on <hi>September</hi> 17. (by the violence of ſome men, who could neither preach themſelves, nor permit it in others) I took up a reſolution (as <hi>David</hi> ſometimes did, when he was tired out with <hi>Saul</hi>'s perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that as ſoon as ever I arrived to ſome fixed place of abode, I would quit that <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> which hitherto (almoſt ever ſince my undertaking it) had only engaged my pains, and exerciſed my patience; and ſo betake my ſelf to ſome other employment, whereby I might perhaps equally profit others, and likewiſe certainly procure more advantage, at leaſt more quiet, to my ſelf. Nor did I think this reſolution could be blamed in me by any, eſpecially by thoſe of the <hi>Epiſcopal Perſwaſion,</hi> ſince they without any ſuch neceſſity ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, yet make no ſcruple to mix ſome <hi>Temporal</hi> with their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Employment, or rather ſo much attend the firſt, that they leave themſelves very little time for minding of the other.</p>
            <p>But how plauſible ſoever my Change might be, yet in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a matter (wherein the whole courſe of my Life and method of my Studies was to be altered) that I might do nothing raſhly, I thought it my duty to communicate my deſign unto my Father, whoſe conſent could I once obtain, I purpoſed then to addreſs my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtudy of the Law, in which his known abilities made him ſo good a guide, that I promiſed my ſelf much happineſs in having his Aſſiſtance, as a Clue, to lead me through all thoſe tedious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths and Meanders of our Engliſh Laws.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:184834:3"/>
            <p>Being full of theſe thoughts, I arrived at <hi>Morton,</hi> my Fathers houſe, on <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. and within few hours obtained not only his Aſſent to, but his Approbation of my Deſign, which I waited only his Recovery effectually to purſue. But it pleaſed God to daſh all this Project, by putting an end to my Father's dayes, who within ten dayes after my arrival, exchanged this Life for a better, and now in an higher and moſt impartial Court, hath received that Reward for his Piety and Loyalty, which on Earth he neither had, nor hoped for.</p>
            <p>With him, my Plot upon the Law proved abortive, and died too; and now more than ever, I thought my ſelf obliged to attend the Study of Divinity, as being hopeleſs of ever attaining to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge in the other, ſince my Director was taken away, who alone was both able and willing to ſmooth thoſe rugged wayes, and make them plain to my enquiry: And thus I bad the Law adieu; firſt, bleſſing God, for his mercy in that, what I thought to be an harſh Providence, <hi>viz.</hi> my removal out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was by God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, meerly to bring me home, to receive the laſt words and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my honoured Father; who, rather diſſolved by Age than broken by Sickneſs, in a moſt calm and Chriſtian manner expired in my Arms.</p>
            <p>The Funeral Solemnities were no ſooner over, but I went up to <hi>London,</hi> partly, to fit my ſelf with Mourning, but principally, to take my final leave of that Honourable Family to which I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly related, and within eight dayes I returned to diſcharge a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, both to my Mother that was living, and to my Father that was dead, part of whoſe laſt words were, <hi>that I ſhould love my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> which I thought <hi>I</hi> could not more effectually manifeſt that <hi>I</hi> did, than by continuing with her in her ſolitude.</p>
            <p>Accordingly <hi>I</hi> brought all my Books to <hi>Morton,</hi> and being now fully ſetled upon the exerciſe of my Miniſtry, <hi>I</hi> laid hold of ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for Preaching, which in that place the abſence of the Miniſter did afford me: To which, beſides the Invitation of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who were <hi>as Sheep ſcattered without a Shepherd) I</hi> had theſe Motives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The very Office of the Miniſtry is by the Apoſtle called a <hi>Stewardſhip,</hi> which ſhews that the gifts whereby any is qualified for the diſcharge of it, are entruſted not for his uſe that hath them, but for theirs who need them. <hi>Stewards</hi> muſt not lay up, but lay out their Lord's Money; which the Apoſtle implies, when having premiſed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184834:3"/>that he would have himſelf and others ſo accounted, <hi>as Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1, 2. he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſubjoyns <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>what remains,</hi> it is required in a Steward <hi>that he be found faithful.</hi> Now that this <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> is nothing elſe, but a careful and diligent miniſtring of what he hath received, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that the Apoſtle ſaith in another place, 1 Cor. 9.16, 17. <hi>Yea, wo unto me if I preach not the Gospel, for a diſpenſation,</hi> or, as in the Greek, <hi>a Stewardſhip is committed to me;</hi> ſo that without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Woe, I</hi> did not ſee how <hi>I</hi> could ſilence my ſelf, or ſurceaſe from Preaching.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The nature of Miniſterial gifts, requires a continual Exerciſe for the improvement of them; for they encreaſe by uſing: <hi>To him that hath,</hi> i. e. <hi>to him that well uſeth what he hath, more ſhall be given;</hi> whereas the <hi>ſlothful ſervant,</hi> who pretended fear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not imploy his Talent, had it preſently taken from him: as Fire, if not blown up, inſenſibly decayes; or as Water, if it hath not a conſtant currant, dryes up, or elſe corrupts and putrifies: So theſe <hi>Gifts of God's Spirit,</hi> which are compared to <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> if they be not imployed for the Edification of others, for which end they were imparted, they are withdrawn, as the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven was from the Jews,</hi> and given to thoſe who bring forth the fruits of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In my moſt impartial thoughts, <hi>I</hi> could ſee no reaſon why <hi>I</hi> ſhould forbear Preaching, but meerly ſuch prudential motives, which, though many little ſtreams, yet at laſt reſolved themſelves into that great Channel, namely, <hi>the fear of men,</hi> againſt which there are ſuch ſpecial Caveats, ſuch poſitive Threats, ſuch conſolatory Promiſes, in Scripture, that of the two, <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> did moſt like a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Divine,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> choſe to be wholly byaſſed by <hi>the fear of God,</hi> in which alone <hi>I</hi> promiſed to my ſelf a final peace, and ſince <hi>I</hi> have found the happy effects of it.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and ſuch-like Arguments (which <hi>I</hi> would inlarge, were <hi>I</hi> not confined to the limits of a Letter) whilſt <hi>I</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Morton, I</hi> conſtantly preached, and that in the Church, ſo oft as the place was unſupplied by others; and that <hi>I</hi> might give an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the World, how little factious or humourſome <hi>I</hi> was in my Opinion (although <hi>I</hi> have but little reverence for Church Holy-days, yet, that <hi>I</hi> might be inſtant <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> as well as in it) <hi>I</hi> did on Chriſtmas-day give the Pariſh a Sermon, though there hath been none for above twelve years before.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:184834:4"/>
            <p>Thus far <hi>I</hi> enjoyed a quiet, a greater than which <hi>I</hi> could not be ambitious of, when on the ſudden <hi>I</hi> was alarmed, firſt with flying Rumors, then with certain Information that there were Warrants iſſued out to apprehend me; and this <hi>I</hi> heard above a fortnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any was actually ſerved upon me.</p>
            <p>I had time and leaſure enough in this interval to take advice, what in that juncture of time would beſt become me to do: and though many of my Friends did counſel me to with-draw my ſelf, urging that of <hi>Solomon, A prudent man foreſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf; but a fool rageth, or ruſheth on, and is confident:</hi> and this they enforced both by our Saviours advice to his Apoſtles <hi>(when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you in one City, fly to another)</hi> and by his practice in himſelf, who frequently concealed himſelf from the Peoples rage, and at laſt when the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had fully concluded of his Arraignment and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it is ſaid expreſly, That <hi>Jeſus therefore walked no more openly among the</hi> Jews, <hi>but went thence into a Country near to the Wilderneſs, and there continued with his Diſciples,</hi> Joh. 11.54. Theſe Examples joyned with the Entreaties of my neareſt Relations, might have warranted me, ſhould I have taken that way to ſecure my ſelf, which the Law of Self-preſervation (without any other inducements) doth prompt moſt others unto. Yet with me none of theſe Arguments did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but I continued fixed in my Reſolution, to abide where I was, and wait the iſſue of all theſe Reports; and that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I was not conſcious to my ſelf, that I had done any thing to deſerve either death or bonds, and therefore I would not by flight betray my own innocency, or by concealment give too juſt an occaſion of ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe I had writ many things concerning matters now in controverſie, for which perhaps I might be queſtioned, and ſhould I have fled from the Tryal, I could never make amends to the Truths I had formerly aſſerted; ſince he ſcarcely deſerves the name of a Chriſtian Writer, who, in the things of God, is not willing to die, for what he hath once upon good grounds defended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I had frequently exhorted others, not to decline Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but if the cauſe was for Righteouſneſs ſake, to look upon all ſuch Tryals as marks of honour; and ſhould I my ſelf have flinched, and becauſe trouble was near, I ſhould not only have contradicted the truth of my Doctrine, but likewiſe, amongſt all my hearers at leaſt, have diſcredited the ſincerity of my Profeſſion.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:184834:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I found upon ſurvey and meaſuring of my own ſtrength, (I mean <hi>my own,</hi> no otherwiſe than as given me by God) that death was not at all terrible to me, but a Priſon was very dreadful; for having been ſo long uſed to the air of liberty, I could ſcarcely with any patience, think of Confinement. This Weakneſs I durſt not indulge, and therefore reſolved to wait and ſee what God would call me to; of whom I might the more confidently beg aſſiſtance, when I had done nothing for my own eaſe, to avoid his diſpoſal. Nor had the contrary Arguments much weight in them; For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Speech of <hi>Solomons,</hi> as moſt of his Proverbs, holds true only in Political Diſtempers, or State Commotions; then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is prudence for a wiſe man to eſcape the danger; but hath no place at all in Chriſtian Tryals, where he that ſuffers when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, is alwayes on the ſafeſt ſide, as acting moſt ſutably to Goſpel Principles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Saviours advice to his Apoſtles, was only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary for that ſeaſon, till they had finiſhed their Miniſtry in <hi>Judea,</hi> and poſſibly at that time there might be ſome reſpect had to their weakneſs, by comparing this place with that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.15, 17. but after our Saviours Reſurrection, we read no more of their flying, but of their perſiſting in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even when the violence of the Perſecution had ſcattered others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Our Saviour knew the exact and critical manner and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of his death, and therefore it is ſaid more than once, that he did this and that, becauſe <hi>he knew all things that ſhould befal him, and his time was not yet fully come;</hi> and this might occaſion his frequent removal: whereas our ignorance of what is to come, ought to make us conceive, that every Tryal which God in his Providence brings upon us, ought without demur to be encountered and undertaken by us, as that whereby he intends himſelf ſome glory, which, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our ſelves, we may, intentionally at leaſt, defeat him of.</p>
            <p>Being thus reſolved, I waited with patience, to ſee what would be the iſſue of all theſe Rumours; but after a fortnights ſtay, finding no effect of them, <hi>I</hi> concluded, the whole fame to be falſe and frivolous, and therefore went on <hi>Saturday,</hi> Jan. 3d. to a Noble Kinſmans houſe of mine (whoſe Name and Worth you know) to fetch home my Siſter, who had there ſpent her Chriſtmaſs; within leſs than an hour after my arrival there, one that was Clerk to Sir <hi>John Bernard,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace in our County, brought the Warrant to me, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184834:5"/>that very night, about eight a clock without more a-do in obedience to it, <hi>I</hi> rode ſix or ſeven miles to Sir <hi>John Bernard</hi>'s houſe; and now from thence, to uſe the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> words with a little alteration, <hi>I go bound in the Spirit to</hi> London, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there, ſave that</hi> my Friends are ready to conjecture, <hi>that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> Acts 20.22, 24.</p>
